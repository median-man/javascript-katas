# Javascript Katas
This is a repository of katas for practicing Javascript. After reading [this blog post][clean-coder-blog], I was inspired to start creating and practicing code katas in a manner after that described in the post.

## Word Wrap
My first Javascript kata. Inspired by [this blog post][clean-coder-blog].

Write a function that takes two arguments--a string and a column number. The function returns a string with line breaks inserted so that no line is longer than the column number. Lines should break at word boundaries.

## Prime Factors
Write a function that takes a whole number greater than 0 and returns an array of its prime factors.

# Fizz Buzz
Develop a function that accepts a number as input:
* Returns 'fizz' if 3 is a factor of the number.
* Returns 'buzz' if 5 is a factor of the number.
* Returns 'fizzbuzz' if 15 is a factor of the number.
* Returns the number if none of the other statements apply.
