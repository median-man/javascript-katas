#Score Keeper Kata

Write a ScoreKeeper unit which is responsible for tracking the score of a
basketball game. The module must provide six methods that will correspond to six
buttons. Each button will score 1, 2, or 3 points for one of the two teams.
There should also be a method to get the score. I discovered this kata on
[Kata-Log](http://kata-log.rocks/score-keeper-kata). The score should be
returned as a string that is always seven characters&mdash;"`000:000`".
