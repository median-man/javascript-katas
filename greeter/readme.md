# Greeter Kata

I found this Kata on [GitHub/wix/tdd-katas](https://github.com/wix/tdd-katas).

## Requirements:

- Write a Greeter class with greet function that receives a name as input and
  outputs Hello <name>. The signature of greet should not change throughout the
  kata. You are allowed to construct Greeter object as you please.
- greet trims the input
- greet capitalizes the first letter of the name
- greet returns Good morning <name> when the time is 06:00-12:00
- greet returns Good evening <name> when the time is 18:00-22:00
- greet returns Good night <name> when the time is 22:00-06:00
- greet logs into console each time it is called
